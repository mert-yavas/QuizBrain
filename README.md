# QuizBrain

## Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and on Day 17 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I'm excited to share the "Quiz Program." This Python application lets users take a quiz, answering a series of questions and receiving a final score. It serves as a practical project to reinforce Python programming concepts and interactive user input handling.

## Required Files and Libraries
To run this quiz program, you will need the following files:

* question_model.py: Defines the Question class, representing a quiz question.
* data.py: Contains the question_data list with quiz questions and answers.
* quiz_brain.py: Implements the QuizBrain class responsible for managing the quiz flow.
* main.py: The main Python script to run the quiz program.
### Python Libraries:
This program uses built-in Python libraries such as input for user interaction.

Please ensure these files are in the same directory before running the program.

### Educational Objectives:
This project is designed to apply various Python concepts and functions, including:

* Class Definitions: Creating and utilizing classes, such as the Question class for representing quiz questions and the QuizBrain class for managing the quiz.
* Lists and Dictionaries: Storing and accessing data using lists and dictionaries, as seen in the question_data list and the MENU dictionary.
* Loops and Conditionals: Implementing for and while loops, as well as if/else statements to control the quiz flow based on user input.
* User Input Handling: Utilizing the input function to collect user responses and validate answers.
* Modularity: Breaking down the program into smaller, manageable classes and functions to enhance code organization and readability.
### Key Features
* Quiz Questions: Displays a series of questions for users to answer.
* Score Tracking: Calculates and displays the user's final score.
* User Interaction: Engages users with interactive questions and input prompts.
* Educational Tool: Provides a hands-on experience for practicing Python concepts in a quiz format.
### Invitation to Participate
